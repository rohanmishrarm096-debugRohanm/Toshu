Toshu Research Suite - Features

This directory describes the features included in the offline Toshu research suite stubs.

Included features:
- Summarizer: Lightweight offline text summarizer (extractive stub).
- Plagiarism: Local similarity checks using hashed n-grams (stub implementation).
- Citation Extractor: Heuristic-based citation/parser for common formats.
- Editor: Simple Vue editor component to compose and annotate research content.

These are intentionally minimal stubs to demonstrate architecture and Tauri integration. They should be replaced or extended with production-ready algorithms and models as needed.
